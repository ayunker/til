# Turn Off Spell Check in Vim

When I'm writing text in vim, I like to turn on [spell
check](https://til.hashrocket.com/posts/69d22497b7-spell-check-in-vim). I don't
always want spell check on, so I toggle it on manually when I'm in a Markdown
or text file: `:set spell`.

While I always remember how to toggle it on, I never remember how to toggle it
*off*:

``` :set nospell ```

It's the same syntax for any setting - if you wanted to turn off `incsearch`
its `:set noincsearch`.
