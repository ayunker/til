# Spellcheck

Vim has a built in spell check. It's not the most full featured, but good enough
for blog posts and the like.

To turn on spell check for the file you have open:
```
:set spell
```

Then, navigate to next misspelling with `]s` and previous with `[s`.

To turn off afterwards:
```
:set nospell
```
