# Screenshot Entire Window in macOS

It feels like there are an absurd number of options with the built in macOS
screenshot tool.

We've seen before you can screenshot the entire screen or select a rectangle
and save them as a file or to your
[clipboard](https://til.hashrocket.com/posts/f7kpcngqnn-saving-screenshots-to-clipboard-on-mac).

Today I Learned there's an option to select an individual window and screenshot
the entire window.

You can do this by hitting `CMD + shift + 4` (with or without `ctrl`), then tap
`space`. The cursor will change to a camera, and then you can click on the
windows you wish to screenshot!
