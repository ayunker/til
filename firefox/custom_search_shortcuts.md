# Custom Search Shortcuts

In addition to the [built in search
shortcuts](https://til.hashrocket.com/posts/val3av930j-firefox-builtin-search-shortcuts)
in firefox, you can also add custom shortcuts in the settings.

This lets you override your default search engine by prepending a keyword in
your address bar. It's a quick shortcut if you want to search for something on
a specific site. The wikipedia one is especially neat in that it'll take you
straight to the wikipedia page if there's a direct hit, no results page you
need to go through first.
