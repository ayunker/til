# Firefox Builtin Search Shortcuts

Firefox has built in search shortcuts in the address bar, making it easy to
search through your bookmarks, tabs, history and actions you can perform. 

In the address bar (which you can [focus with `Cmd +
L`](https://til.hashrocket.com/posts/l91fwohhil-focus-the-url-bar)), including
the following characters in your search will:

* `*` -> search within your bookmarks
* `%` -> search within your tabs 
* `^` -> search within your history
* `>` -> search within actions - like **Manage bookmarks**, **View downloads**,
**Take a screenshot**

The neat thing is you don't need to start your search with the shortcut, you
can add it anywhere. So you can start typing something in the address bar,
remember you visited the page yesterday, and add `^` at the end to filter down
to your history
