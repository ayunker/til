# Check Your Shell Scripts with Shellcheck

Today I learned about `shellcheck`, a static analysis tool for shell scripts.
I'll be the first to admit that my bash scripts contain a multitude of sins, so
a too like this is invaluable to help clean them up.

It can be installed through home brew (`brew install shellcheck`), but also has
a web editor available at https://www.shellcheck.net/ if you don't want to
install it.

```bash 
$ shellcheck my_script
```
