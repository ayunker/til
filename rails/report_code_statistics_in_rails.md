# Report Code Statistics in Rails

You can run `rails stats` to print out statistics around lines of code,
classes, methods, code to test ratio, etc for your rails app. It'll print out a
table like this:

```
$ bin/rails stats

_(Don't mind the code to test ratio...it's a proof of concept app ðŸ˜…)_

h/t Joel Hawksley, I learned about this from the excellent
[talk](https://hawksley.org/2025/02/10/lessons-from-5-years-of-ui-architecture-at-github.html)
he gave at Chicago Ruby last week.
